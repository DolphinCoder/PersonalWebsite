      <p><strong>Feb 2022-May 2025 | PARC Ranger, Reed College</strong></p>
      <p>Worked in the Reed College Performing Arts Resource Center as a circulation desk worker and tech support.</p>
      <p><strong>Sep 2023-May 2025 | Math 141 and Biology 352 Individual Tutor, Reed College</strong></p>
      <p>Assisted students in one-on-one tutoring sessions in statistics and bioinformatics. Worked with students 
        on effective study and time management techniques, debugged code, and explained difficult concepts. </p>
      <p><strong>Jun-Aug 2024 | NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Program Intern, Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)</strong></p>
      <p>Participated in a 10-week NOAA Hollings Program internship in the Ocean Molecular Ecology lab at PMEL. Combined data 
        from an automated environmental DNA (eDNA) sampler with oceanographic data from a mooring at the same location to investigate
        the relationship between species presence and oxygen saturation. Participated in field eDNA sampling and filtration as well 
        as sampler cleaning and preparation. Presented results to PMEL and the NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Program Symposium.</p>
      <p><strong>Sep-Dec 2023 | Organic Chemistry Grader, Reed College</strong></p>
      <p>Worked independently to give constructive feedback on weekly organic chemistry problem sets. Informed professor 
        of concepts that many students were struggling with in order to inform lectures and review sessions.</p>
      <p><strong>Jun-Aug 2023 | REU Intern, Wetherbee Lab at University of Rhode Island</strong></p>
      <p>Participated in the URI Graduate School of Oceanography SURFO program as an intern, attending career development 
        and science writing workshops. Analyzed data from a decade of acoustic and satellite telemetry shark tagging in 
        order to identify the environmental cues that lead sand tiger sharks to leave their aggregation sites on the US East Coast in 
        order to identify potential explanations for shark migration patterns. Completed a final write-up and presentation.</p>
      <p><strong>Sep-Dec 2022 | Math 141 (Statistics) Teaching Assistant (TA)</strong></p>
      <p>Assisted statistics professor during lab and helped students code in R, held weekly office hours.</p>
      <p><strong>Sep-Dec 2022 | Chemistry 101 Lab TA, Reed College</strong></p>
      <p>Assisted introductory chemistry professor during lab sections, helped troubleshoot student experiments, enforced lab safety 
        rules, communicated with the professor about common points of confusion for students to improve lab instruction in the future, 
        and graded lab reports.</p>
      <p><strong>May-Aug 2022 | Lab Intern, Reyns Lab at University of San Diego</strong></p>
      <p>Shadowed a graduate student working to measure seasonal growth of <italic>Amathia verticillata</italic> and assisted her with YSI probe 
        sampling, collecting <italic>A. verticillata</italic> samples, and data entry. Conducted an independent research project to quantify 
        reproduction in the barnacle <italic>Chthamalus fissus</italic> on the southern California coast. Measured barnacle diameters & weights 
        and counted eggs and parasites, then conducted data analysis and concluded that barnacle mass varies seasonally, barnacles 
        with greater mass have larger broods, and the connection between season, lunar phase, and brood size needs to be investigated further.</p>
